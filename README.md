DUN is a lightweight pixel multicharacter dungeon game built on the Solana Devnet Blockchain. Developed with Kaboom and powered by thirdweb and alchemy, DUN offers players the opportunity to earn valuable loot and become part of the growing Play-to-Earn gaming community. Our motivation is to enable users to own what they earn, and we are committed to improving the user experience of Web3 gaming and finding ways to smoothly convert Web2 gamers to the Web3 gaming ecosystem.
